As AI makes it easier for anyone to build small apps and tools, those tools also become easier to replace. If a productivity app or reporting dashboard can be created in an afternoon, it stops being a durable advantage on its own.

The SaaS companies that are most likely to survive are the ones that operate across teams and across organizations, not just inside one person's workflow. They're the platforms that have access to data you don't have on your own, like benchmarks, patterns, and insights drawn from many similar companies, aggregated and anonymized in ways that help you run your business better.

And yet, there's a real tension there. For any organization, their data feels deeply personal and strategic, and giving it up for aggregation doesn't come naturally. It requires trust that the data will be handled responsibly, protected, and used to strengthen everyone, not weaken anyone.

That's the paradox: collective intelligence is where the future value lies, but it only works if enough people are willing to participate in it.
