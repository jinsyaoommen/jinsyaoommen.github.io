I spent a day coding with Claude and it was both exhilarating and exhausting.

We built in one day what normally would have taken me two weeks. That alone feels like magic. The code was real, working, and meaningful. But at the end of the day, my brain was fried in a way that felt different from normal development fatigue.

Usually, when I build something over two or three weeks, my understanding grows gradually. I carry context forward slowly:

- I internalize the architecture
- I remember why decisions were made
- I form a mental map of how everything connects

That cognitive load is spread out. My brain has time to consolidate.

With Claude, that compression disappeared. We moved so fast that my brain had to absorb weeks of architectural context, design tradeoffs, and implementation detail all at once. I wasn't just writing code. I was constantly:

- Evaluating suggestions
- Holding system-level design in my head
- Checking for correctness
- Deciding what to trust
- Deciding what to override

It felt less like typing and more like continuous high-speed systems thinking.

The surprising part is that the exhaustion wasn't from effort. It was from density. Too many decisions. Too much context. Too quickly.

This made me realize something important: **AI doesn't remove cognitive load. It concentrates it.**

Before, time was your buffer. Time let understanding emerge naturally. Now, speed removes that buffer. You still need understanding, but you need it immediately.

There is a hidden tradeoff:

- Faster output
- Higher cognitive intensity

And that changes how you work.

You start needing:

- More intentional breaks
- More explicit documentation
- More "slow thinking" after fast building
- More time to revisit and truly own what was created

Claude didn't replace my thinking. It accelerated the surface area of what I had to think about.

And honestly, that's a good thing. It means the work is still mine. But it also means we need to build new habits around pacing, review, and recovery.

AI lets us sprint through development. Our brains still need a cool-down lap to make the work truly ours.

There was also a quieter thought at the end of the day: maybe I'm just getting too old for this pace.

Not in a negative way. More in a "this is a different kind of intensity" way. My brain wanted time to breathe, to wander, to settle into what we had built. The speed was thrilling, but it was also relentless. There was no natural pause where understanding could catch up to creation.

And don't get me wrong, it was absolutely exhilarating. It is exciting in a way that's hard to overstate. If this is what one person can do in a day, imagine what this means for a team of software folks who are always constrained by time and capacity. Suddenly, the bottleneck isn't how fast you can write code. It's how fast you can think, align, and absorb.

That's a profound shift.

It makes me think the future of software teams won't just be about productivity. It will be about cognitive sustainability. How do we move fast without burning out our ability to reason, understand, and make good decisions?

Maybe being "too old for this pace" really just means being experienced enough to recognize that speed without reflection isn't mastery. The real skill now is learning how to balance the exhilaration of acceleration with the patience of understanding.
